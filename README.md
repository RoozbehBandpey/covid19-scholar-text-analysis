# Using Azure Synapse to explore COVID-19 data

In the current global pandemic caused by COVID-19 virus, leveraging any technological tools for analyzing current data is helpful for scientist to prepare vaccine as soon as possible.

In this repository [CORD-19](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) dataset is used to gain insight over hidden behavior of the virus.
The analytic tool that is used is [Microsoft Azure Synapse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/)

## Data
CORD-19 is a huge body of scientific papers over COVID-19 virus
## Tools and Requirements

### Why Azure Synapse?
Azure Synapse is an analytics service that brings together enterprise data warehousing and Big Data analytics. Although using Synapse for purpose of exploring CORD-19 dataset might sound like an overkill because Synapse is initially designed to handel data and concurrent queries on way more heavier workloads, but it has also significant capabilities to ingest, prepare, manage, and serve data for immediate BI and machine learning needs. Since Azure Synapse is new in market, the main purpose of using it is experimental.
